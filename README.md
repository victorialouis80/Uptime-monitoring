To set up the script:

Create a new directory on your local machine.

Create a new file in the directory and name it index.php.
Copy the script code into index.php.
Customize the configuration parameters in the $config array as per your requirements.
Save the changes.
Create another file in the same directory and name it .gitignore (note the leading dot). This file will prevent certain files from being tracked by Git.
Inside the .gitignore file, add the following lines:
Copy code
.DS_Store
uptime_log.txt
Save the .gitignore file.
Initialize a new Git repository in the directory by running git init.
Add all the files by running git add ..
Commit the files by running git commit -m "Initial commit".
Now, you can create a new repository on GitHub, push your local repository to GitHub, and your uptime monitoring script will be ready for upload.

Please note that this script only checks the server's HTTP response code to determine if it's up or down. You may need to customize it further based on your specific monitoring needs or requirements.
